		//		This the graphics rendering bridge for W3C Canvas compliant browsers.
		//		Since Canvas is an immediate mode graphics api, with no object graph or
		//		eventing capabilities, use of this module alone will only add in drawing support.
		//		The additional module, canvasWithEvents extends this module with additional support
		//		for handling events on Canvas.  By default, the support for events is now included
		//		however, if only drawing capabilities are needed, canvas event module can be disabled
		//		using the dojoConfig option, canvasEvents:true|false.
		//		The id of the Canvas renderer is 'canvas'.  This id can be used when switch Dojo's
		//		graphics context between renderer implementations.  See gfx/_base.switchRenderer
		//		API.
